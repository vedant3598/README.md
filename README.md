## About Me
My name is Vedant Shah and I am 3A Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. I aspire to specialize in Artificial Intelligence and love solving complex problems
people face on a daily basis (check out some of my projects such as Ad Astra and UBank). I am currently a DevOps Engineer intern at NCR Corporation and am an incoming
